# Disney Game

Small game where the player needs to correctly guess the film or tv-show of a Disney character.
- each game has **10** rounds
- each round should display a picture of the character and **4 answers**, one of them being the correct one
- the player only has **one** guess per round
- characters for each round should appear **randomly**
- at the end of the 10 rounds, the **total score should be displayed**



## Installation
The application is using Nextjs for the backend and Reactjs for the frontend.
The dependency packages are Tailwindcss and DaisyUi. The packages were used so I can prototype the application quickly with some pre built components and utility classes.
Cypress is also used for testing.


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
